<h1>This Website</h1>
<h3>This website was actually a bit of a learning project for me to put my HTML CSS and Javascript into practice. It's all my 
    own code. You've probably seen 
    most of it already but take another look around if you wish... Theres a few things I need to add when I get a chance like a navigation header and information popups, so expect some changes soon, as well as some new projects...</h3>

<h1>Play 4 in a row against an AI</h1>
<h3>This was actually my first HTML Javascript CSS project that I
     took on with the goal of learning as I went along. The project is a game of
      4 in a row rendered with CSS elements and animations, so I was forced to confront stylesheets head on. The board is variable in size,
       and you play against a minimax algorithm I wrote. This was a great opportunity for me 
       to learn some in depth stuff like pseudo elements and asyncronous functions. There's room for improvement, but
        try it out...</h3>

    <h3>Do you have a green thumb for maths? Or are your maths skills wilting? My solo entry for February 2023's global game jam 'Roots' is a race against time to solve as many square roots as you can.
        The game jam was a great opportunity to get back into using Unity again. I learnt a new 2D animation technique for sprites and got some good practice for my next game jam. I had fun!</h3>
